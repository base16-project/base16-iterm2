# Tinted iTerm2

[Base16] and [Base24] themes for iTerm2. See [Tinted Theming] for more
information.  

Formerly base16-iterm2, but now this repository supports more scheme
systems than Base16 so it has been renamed.

## Usage

### Manual

- Open `Preferences` > `Profiles` > `Colors` or `âŒ˜ + i` > `Colors`
- Click on `Color Presets` > `Import` and import your favorite theme
  from this repo
- Load the theme by clicking on `Color Presets` and selecting it

## Bright Ansi colors

Base16 will use the same colors for normal and bright variants. Base24
supports bright ANSI colors.
